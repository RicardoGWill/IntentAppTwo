# IntentAppTwo
This app (Intent App Two) goes along with another app (Intent App One).  "Intent App Two" here has an implicit intent (taking you to "Intent App One" if it is on the same device).  Thus, these two apps show off how you can go from one separate app to another, and illustrate the difference between an explicit intent and an implicit intent.
